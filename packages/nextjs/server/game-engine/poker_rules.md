Poker Rules: Streets, Actions, and Flow (2–9 Players)

Scope and Assumptions

- Game: No‑Limit Texas Hold’em, 2–9 players.
- Streets: Preflop → Flop → Turn → River → Showdown.
- Blinds/Antes: Small blind (SB), big blind (BB), optional antes.
- Actions: fold, check, call, bet, raise (all‑in permitted at any time).
- Terms: “To call” means matching the current highest commitment on the street. “Min raise” means the size of the last full bet/
raise (short all‑ins don’t reset the min‑raise).

Seating, Blinds, and Dealing

- Preflop: Each seated player with chips receives two private cards.
- Blinds: SB and BB are posted before any preflop action. If antes are used, all active players post antes.
- Heads‑Up (2 players): Button posts SB; the other player posts BB. Preflop first to act is the Button/SB. Postflop first to act
is the BB.
- 3–9 players: Button is dealer. SB and BB sit immediately left of the Button (clockwise). Preflop first to act is UTG
(immediately left of BB). Postflop first to act is immediately left of the Button.

Street Flow and Legal Actions

- Preflop
    - Action begins with the first player to act (HU: Button/SB; 3–9: UTG).
    - Legal actions: fold; call (up to BB or current raise); raise (at least a min‑raise over the current bet); all‑in (any
amount ≥ call).
    - BB Option: If everyone only calls up to the BB (no raise), action returns to the BB who may check or raise.
    - Street ends when: all players have either folded or matched the highest bet (or are all‑in), and action has returned to the
last aggressor, or only one player remains.
- Flop (3 community cards)
    - Current bet resets to 0. First to act is left of Button (HU: BB).
    - Legal actions: check; bet (≥ BB); call; raise (≥ last full bet/raise); fold; all‑in.
    - Round ends with the same completion condition as preflop.
- Turn (1 card) and River (1 card)
    - Same as Flop: bet/raise rules apply; first to act remains left of Button (HU: BB).
    - Short all‑ins that are less than a full raise do not reopen raising for prior callers; players may call the short all‑in
or fold.
- Example lines (3–9 players):
    - No raise preflop: UTG calls, SB calls, action returns to BB → BB may check (see flop) or raise (then action continues).
    - Raised pot preflop: UTG raises, SB folds, BB calls → action returns to UTG (if no further raises, round ends).
    - Postflop: Player A bets, Player B raises, Player C folds, Player A calls → round ends and next street is dealt.

All‑In and Side Pots

- Any player may go all‑in. When stack sizes differ, side pots form automatically based on committed amounts.
- Short all‑in raises do not set a new minimum raise size; only full raises do.
- When all remaining players are all‑in, remaining streets are dealt automatically and the hand proceeds to showdown.

Showdown

- If more than one player remains after the river betting round, hands are revealed.
- Best five‑card hand from seven cards (2 hole + 5 board) wins each eligible pot; ties split evenly (with any odd chip awarded by
house rule).
- If everyone but one player folds at any point, the last remaining player wins immediately (uncalled amounts returned to last
aggressor).

Two‑Player vs Multi‑Way Differences

- Heads‑Up: Button posts SB; preflop Button/SB acts first; postflop BB acts first.
- 3–9 Players: UTG acts first preflop; postflop action starts left of Button. Otherwise, rules are the same.

Timeouts and Irregularities

- Timeouts result in an automatic fold if the player has action and cannot check.
- If an out‑of‑turn action occurs, it is ignored; action proceeds in proper order.
